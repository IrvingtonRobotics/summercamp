					Hi! I am a rising senior at Irvington High School, and head of this summer camp. Technology is influencing the
					world in amazing ways, and I want to get the next generation involved in this process. As a Taekwondo
					and tennis instructor, I have been helping students reach their physical and mental potential for four
					years. As a seasoned instructor, I wish to combine my teaching experience with my technological
					knowledge, and help students in this summer camp learn more about robotics, programming, and 3D design.
					Through doing/learning from data-analysis programming at a UCSF research lab, and spending countless
					hours designing/building to compete in national robotics competitions using Arduino, and VEX
					hardware/software, I have ample information to teach!

					Hi, I am an upcoming senior at Irvington High School. Through several years of developing and teaching successful
					coding and robotics projects, I have become professionally fluent in Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Python.
					Additionally, in an effort to spread my passion for robotics, I founded an international teaching
					program that brought the LEGO Mindstorms framework to developing schools. I have become competent in
					using Linux, Java, and Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) through Autodesk Inventor. Additionally, I have ample
					website design experience in HTML and CSS. Through this summer camp, I want to combine the vast
					technological knowledge I have with my experience teaching robotics and managing teaching programs to
					help students get interested in technology at a young age! Hobbies include playing guitar, violin, &
					piano,
					playing PC games, building custom PCs, and drinking milk tea.

					Hi! I am an upcoming senior at Irvington High School. I have a lot of
					experience with Arduino and C programming, having made many small projects and taken summer programs on
					these topics myself. I plan to use the experiences I had as a student to make this year's Irvington
					summer camp better than the programs I took. I am also adept at using Autodesk Inventor, an industry
					standard Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, as I have taken Engineering Design courses and worked
					with it in my own free time. Through robotics, I have gained experience working with electronics as
					well.

					Hi, I am a rising Junior at Irvington High School. I have been involved in robotics
					for 3 years now. I did one year of Lego robotics and two years of VEX robotics. Additionally,
					I made two mobile applications using app inventor and participated in International Competitions.
					At the same time, I am also fluent in Java,and Robot C. The main reason I chose to do robotics is
					because it is an application of all three types of engineering, software, mechanical, and
					electronics, and through this summer camp I would like to give young kids a chance to experience
					all the three types of engineering meshed into one discipline.

					Hello, I am a rising junior at Irvington High School.
					I have been involved with the high school robotics team for two years.
					During the two years, I was able to learn much from the mentors about
					simple and complex mechanical, hardware and software aspects and concepts.
					I also have experience with programming in C and C++. In addition, I have
					been able to teach and educate students about robotics, allowing me to
					gain the necessary teaching experience. Overall, I have chosen robotics
					over other STEM-related activities, since robotics is able to efficiently
					integrate the different aspects of hardware and software and really show
					the relationship between the two.

					Hi, I am currently a rising junior at
					Irvington High School. I’ve always had an interest in technology and
					so I spent 2 years at Irvington Robotics, where I’ve learned many
					things that I hope to be able to pass on. Furthermore, I have an
					understanding of the Arduino microcontroller and the circuitry needed
					for it along with some knowledge of python. I genuinely enjoy robotics
					and the interaction between the software and the hardware that bring a
					cohesive and simply striking creation.
