	This camp is taught by VEX Robotics Team captains of the nationally appraised Irvington Robotics Academy. These
	leaders are skilled in numerous aspects of robotics through the creation of internationally recognized
	robotics projects,
	coaching and mentoring younger students through all steps of the robotics design process, and spending countless
	hours themselves building, modeling, programming, and competing at tournaments with teams from around the
	world.

					Hi! I am a rising senior at Irvington High School, and head of this summer camp. Technology is influencing the
					world in amazing ways, and I want to get the next generation involved in this process. As a Taekwondo
					and tennis instructor, I have been helping students reach their physical and mental potential for four
					years. As a seasoned instructor, I wish to combine my teaching experience with my technological
					knowledge, and help students in this summer camp learn more about robotics, programming, and 3D design.
					Through doing/learning from data-analysis programming at a UCSF research lab, and spending countless
					hours designing/building to compete in national robotics competitions using Arduino, and VEX
					hardware/software, I have ample information to teach!

					Hi, I am an upcoming senior at Irvington High School. Through several years of developing and teaching successful
					coding and robotics projects, I have become professionally fluent in Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and Python.
					Additionally, in an effort to spread my passion for robotics, I founded an international teaching
					program that brought the LEGO Mindstorms framework to developing schools. I have become competent in
					using Linux, Java, and Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) through Autodesk Inventor. Additionally, I have ample
					website design experience in HTML and CSS. Through this summer camp, I want to combine the vast
					technological knowledge I have with my experience teaching robotics and managing teaching programs to
					help students get interested in technology at a young age! Hobbies include playing guitar, violin, &
					piano,
					playing PC games, building custom PCs, and drinking milk tea.

					Hi! I am an upcoming senior at Irvington High School. I have a lot of
					experience with Arduino and C programming, having made many small projects and taken summer programs on
					these topics myself. I plan to use the experiences I had as a student to make this year's Irvington
					summer camp better than the programs I took. I am also adept at using Autodesk Inventor, an industry
					standard Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, as I have taken Engineering Design courses and worked
					with it in my own free time. Through robotics, I have gained experience working with electronics as
					well.

					Hi, I am a rising Junior at Irvington High School. I have been involved in robotics
					for 3 years now. I did one year of Lego robotics and two years of VEX robotics. Additionally,
					I made two mobile applications using app inventor and participated in International Competitions.
					At the same time, I am also fluent in Java,and Robot C. The main reason I chose to do robotics is
					because it is an application of all three types of engineering, software, mechanical, and
					electronics, and through this summer camp I would like to give young kids a chance to experience
					all the three types of engineering meshed into one discipline.
